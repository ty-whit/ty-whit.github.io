Sometimes picking a game for our kids is difficult. In my opinion, there's nothing better than a personal recommendation from a friend who knows what they're talking about. While you may not know me individually, I'd like to get as close to that as possible. I talk about this in much more details in [[Motivation|Reason for this blog]]. Go check it out. 

Here are some of my favorite games I'd recommend for 
Children (5-10): 
- [[Sticky Business]]

Pre-teens (8-12):
- [[Stardew Valley]] (wip)

Teenagers:
- [[CloudPunk]]
