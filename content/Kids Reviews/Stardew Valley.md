I didn’t grow up with the Nintendo home consoles. I grew up watching my mom play the Sega Genesis. Between all three classic sonic games, and the light gun game Lethal Enforcers, I never saw or heard anything about Harvest Moon. When I was a bit older, we got a PlayStation. Yes, I recognize that harvest moon did come to PlayStation pretty early in the series life, but I was living on the entire Crash Bandicoot and Spyro franchises at that point in time. Hundred-hour long JRPGs with epic story lines were not what we played when I was young. Much less farming or cute life sim games. 

Because of that, I had no nostalgia or rose-tented glasses to put on when I first picked up Stardew Valley. I did already have an affinity for indie games and I was looking for a cute game that could play with my wife. We were just starting a Ph.D., so time and money were short. She was also pregnant with our first child, so this also gave her something to do when she was alone at home while going through a rough pregnancy. 

We started playing it together, immediately jumping into a multiplayer farm and we both fell in love with it very quickly. I admit that my ADHD brain fell off pretty quickly, but I think I likely should have played by myself before jumping into a farm with her. She on the other hand has over 100 hours in the very first farm she started back in 2018. 

There really isn’t anything extra I could really add to the conversation when it comes to this game. It’s a wonderful game, made by a wonderful person. I love the story elements. I love the fact that you get to interact with a small community and work to build up what has become run down. (I also love the subtle jab at capitalism, but that’s not the topic of this blog.) I love the slow-paced gameplay that focuses small improvements from one in-game day to the next. 

In short, your kids should play this game. If they’re familiar with games, they are likely going to just fine on their own. If they’re a little younger and don’t have a good grip on typical game systems, you should play it with them. The only point that could prove difficult are the things like inventory management and the combat caves. 

The inventory system is necessary for a significant portion of the game’s progression. You need to be monitoring the crafting tab to build certain things which will help on your farm. If your backpack gets too full, you need to build chests to store your resources. You also should build various buildings, like coops, barns, and silos, to progress further in the game. All this item management could prove difficult for kids who are not used to these tasks. 

The other part of the game that could prove difficult is the combat portions of the game. I’d like to say that the game is possible to be played without engaging with the combat, but there are several items that can only be found by fighting monster and exploring the caves. While the combat isn’t difficult, it does sometime require some good timing of blocks and attacks. Not to mention correct orientation of your character to ensure the attacks land as expected.

All this can be fixed with the game’s extensive multiplayer options. My experience of this game has been the various PC builds. I purchased the game through [GOG](https://www.gog.com/), which provides the user with DRM-Free versions of games. In my case, I was able to install the game on both my laptop and my wife’s laptop. This allowed us to play a multiplayer farm from our own computers as long as we were on the same local network (just like the good old days of LAN parties). It can also be played online if you run it through a client like Steam or GOG Galaxy, but you will need to determine if your children should be playing online. There is no matchmaking service, it’s all peer-to-peer, meaning you have to share information with the person before being able to join their game, be it an IP address (set up with port forwarding) or a game code that connects you to their game instance. 

However, all versions of the game (PC and Consoles) support local/split-screen multiplayer. Meaning, you and your littles can jump into a farm and play together. I haven’t explored too much around the limitations of this mode (my oldest still don’t quite have the coordination to handle the dungeons). 



the reason you and your kids should play this game is because it encourages the player to become a part of the community by talking to your neighbors, giving gifts to everyone, listening to the dialog and reactions of the characters to get to know them better. It also teaches them about time management, as certain things can only happen within certain time periods. This is a really cute and relaxed game about living a slower life in a remote farming village. There are so many secrets to be found in this game that you can keep playing for hundreds of hours.
