I love playing video games, but I have more than enough responsibilities as a dad with a full time job, which doesn't leave me with much time to actually play games. I'll let this be a section where I can dump thoughts about specific games I'm currently playing. I will likely use these thoughts when writing a final review to put in the [[Kids Reviews/index|Kids Reviews]] section.
