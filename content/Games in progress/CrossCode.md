I love this game so far. I love the way this game's combat is handled. It's aggressive, frenetic, challenging, strategic. I suck at it, for sure, but it's still extremely fun. 

In this game, you play as a character who struggles to remember her past. Instead of therapy to manage your amnesia, you log into this semi-physical MMORPG that is located on one of the moons of Saturn (It's a sci-fi game. Cut it some slack, okay?). The given to the character is to play through the story of the MMORPG in hopes that you can reconnect to  your memories.

Given it's position as a game within a game, all the character upgrades fall very nicely into play with what your expectation of how an RPG should unfold: Skill trees, quests, inventory, armor and weapons to upgrade your stats, unlocked abilities. 

As the game goes on, it reveal more and more about the world, who you are, what is going on, and who the actual big bad evil guy is. I'll try to avoid spoilers in any future updates, but I'm enjoying the plot twists as well as the combat challenges. The game does feel a bit "on rails" as far as story progression goes, but it was never meant to be a [[Skyrim]] or [[Witcher 3]].
