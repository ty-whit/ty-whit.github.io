I haven't played this game very much but, I think it's a pretty fun concept. It feels similar to something like [[Minecraft]] or Rust but you are a viking, trying to do something related to something in viking mythology. Its got a lot of tools you can craft, resources you can gather, buildings you can build, and monsters you can fine. I will say that the combat is a bit janky, at least on controller (playing it mostly on a Steam Deck).

I also find it fun that you can create a server (hosted either in your home or in a cloud provider) and host play in the same environment with any and all your friends, even if you're not able to play at the exact same time. I probably won't write a full kids review on this game, but your teenage are probably fine to play this one.
