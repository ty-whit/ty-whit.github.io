I've got ADHD. It can suck sometimes. Most of the time this is just because people don't understand what ADHD actually is or how it makes things in the world difficult. Ya see, the world we currently live in is constructed in such a way that it caters to a specific brain type, which we call neurotypical. Autism and ADHD are what we call neurodivergent. All this means is that the brain is wired a little different from most people. Having ADHD is not bad, it's just a little different, and the biggest thing that can be done to demystify, destigmatize, and normalize other brain types. That way, we can get a long better and accommodate the needs of our closest friends and family members and not be scared of a diagnosis if it ever comes in your life.
