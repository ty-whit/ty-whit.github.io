Whether it's a podcast while I drive, a video while I do dishes, or some music while work, something must be going on in by brain. I know it's getting especially bad when I instinctively pull out my phone to watch TikTok while I fill up my cup at the fridge or walk up the stairs. I often catch myself trying to finish a video I started in the bathroom while I wash my hands, only to find myself scrolling to the next video (or past the next three) using my nose because my hands are wet.
