title: How to get bored
draft: true
---

I sometimes have this bad habit of trying to watch YouTube videos while I work. It is never as productive as I want it to be. Often times I'll just sit there, scrolling through while I try to find something interesting. It also depends a lot on the type of task that I'm doing that day. If it's one of those more brainless tasks like copying and pasting a bunch of data, that's fairly easy. Debugging a script that takes about 5 minutes will almost always have something going on in a different window or screen. I recognize what my problem is: Boredom.

I can't stand being bored. I have to have something playing in my brain at all times. This damn thing that we call ADHD gets the best of me quite often and I feel like I have to have something going on while I work on other things. Whether it's a podcast while I drive, a video while I do dishes, or some music while work, something must be going on in by brain. I know it's getting especially bad when I instinctively pull out my phone to watch TikTok while I fill up my cup at the fridge or walk up the stairs. I often catch myself trying to finish a video I started in the bathroom while I wash my hands, only to find myself scrolling to the next video (or past the next three) using my nose because my hands are wet. 

I've tried to stop at least the social media addiction before through things like time limits on my phone, or removing TikTok and other socials for a bit just to give myself a reset. However, I often find myself barreling past my timers, ignoring my downtime limiters, and just scrolling and flipping back and forth just constantly. It get's prety depressing sometimes. 

I often float around the self-help, phosophical, journaling, and minimalisim sides of YouTube in addition to a lot of the gaming and tech related content I get. I've seen a wide variety of videos about switching to a dumb phone, be it a high-tech modern dumb phone like those made by Punkt or LightPhone, or a fairly simple, older style flip phone. I've even seen a fair share of videos talking about how to set up different iOS and Android launchers to as if they were a light phone. One of my favorite flavors of these videos is actually the "dedicated devices" experiences, where the author talks about how life-changing it was to have dedicated things in their bags for each of the needs: 
- the iPod for audiophile levels of algorithmless music listeneing
- the childhood Gameboy Advance or Nintendo DS to play all the retro classics
- the flip phone for calling their friends and loved ones
- the point-and-shoot for odd photos or camcorder for b-roll
- the book, which is not a device, but fills the need for entertainment

While I long for this type of lifestyle, I also recognize I am a tinker that loves tech devices that why I ended up with 
- a phone that I use to 
    - write this blog
    - read from my books server
    - stream music and movies from plex
    - emulate retro games
    - play modern iOS games
- an android phone that can 
    - play android games,
    - read the same books
    - steam the same music and movies
    - emulate the same games
    - play modern Android games
    - play Pico-8 Games (I should write a [[Pico-8|Kids Revies]] for that..)
- a Nintendo 3DS that can 
    - play
